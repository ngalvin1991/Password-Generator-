## Description
The idea of this assignment was to create code using Javascript to make the Password Generator functional (using prompts).
This included allowing the user to input a password length between 10 & 64 characters and then select certain options, in this case; Numbers, Special Characters, Uppercase Characters and Lowercase Characters.
Once the above information was inputted by the user a password would be generated into the text box.

## Installation

This shows an example of the next prompts, the example below is if the user would like to input numbers, once they click 'ok' (yes) or 'cancel' (no) it will move onto the next prompt.
